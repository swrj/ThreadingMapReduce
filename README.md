# Map Reduce on Threads

This project implements MapReduce on a single machine that replaces multiple clusters with threads in order to speed up large scale data processing with parallelism.

## Usage: 
compile with gcc using the -pthread and -O flags. Run the ./ file with a file you need to process.
